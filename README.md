Express Todo CRUD

We've created a db.json file with initial todo data.
We've implemented an API to get all todos (GET /todos).
We've implemented an API to add a new todo (POST /todos).
We've implemented an API to update the status of all todos with even IDs from false to true (PUT /todos/update-even).
We've implemented an API to delete all todos whose status is true (DELETE /todos/completed).
